ok so i have attached all the relevant and required files...basically i want to now do part 4 of assignment's sdn controller part... for reference i have given you the topology we need to use the config file we need to use exactly...the topology you can slightly modify to enable usage of OVSSwitch now (OSPF cant use them but sdn can)... and a runner similar to the one attached that simulates link failure and also performs iperf etc and then logs the result in two log files named h1_sdn_iperf.log and h2_sdn_iperf.log ...which will have similar stats like those two log files attached...obviously sdn controller's convergence time will almost be negligible hence we wont be seeing any 0 bandwidth...the sdn controller code should inherit full code from the p3_l3spf.py code attached and should just simply add in the code to handle the link failure case in which basically we would have to recalculate the next best available path once a link goes down and when it comes back up do the same again....please do all this...give three codes : topo , spf, runner.... and then give the commands to run...like ryu-manager --observable-links p4_l3spf_lf.py something like this and in other terminal runner.py sudo....

ok so i want to implement the part 4 of assignment : sdn controller subpart... it is almost same as that of ospf...uses same config.json file...change in topology is probably use of ovs switch instead of linux controller ...there is not gonna be much of a change in the runner...for sdn controller : take the code in p3_l3spf.py and just add in the code to handle link failure in that ...dont modify anything else...the command to run should also be similar : 
sudo python3 p4_runner.py --input-file=p4_config.json  instead of p4_runner.py it will be p4_sdn_runner.py... so yeah give three codes : p4_sdn_runner.py, p4_sdn_topo.py, and p4_l3spf_lf.py ..... in case of link failure basically rules are uninstalled and again installed by recalculating the rules and same iin case the link comes back up...generate two log files by sdn_runner namely h1_sdn_iperf.log and h2_sdn_iperf.log

ok i have attached the relevant files...i want you to implement sdn subpart of the 4th part of the assignment pdf...and give me p4_sdn_runner.py p4_sdn_topo.py p4_l3spf_lf.py .... the topology should remain same but should use ovs switches now and ryu controller should be used...runner should generate tests results into h1_iperf_sdn.log and h2_iperf_sdn.log...and also do the graph thing mentioned in the assignment pdf for comparison of ospf vs sdn throughput ...both curves in same graph .....please do all these....p4_l3spf_lf.py should basically add in the code to handle link failure inside the p3_l3spf.py... please  do all this
